        <div class="tl-body">
          <p>Passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) is a labor law that prohibits employment discrimination against anyone 40 years of age and older</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="tl-entry">
        <div class="tl-body">
          <p>The ADEA applies to employers with 20 or more employees and stipulates that
    employers are not allowed to hire, terminate, promote, or decide an employee’s
    compensation based on age. The law also forbids discrimination in other aspects
    of employment (e.g., wages, job assignments, layoffs, training, and fringe
    benefits).</p>

      <div class="tl-entry">
        <div class="tl-title">1990</div>
        <div class="tl-body">
          <p>A clause was added to the ADEA that prevented the forced retirement of tenured employees such as college professors. The Older Workers Benefit Protection Act amended the ADEA, prohibiting employers from denying benefits to older employees. Congress recognized that the cost of providing certain
    benefits to older workers was greater than the cost of providing those same
    benefits to younger workers</p>

      <div class="tl-entry">
        <div class="tl-title">2017</div>
        <div class="tl-body">
          <p>According to the USEEOC (2017), examples of age discrimination against older
    workers are: (a) not getting hired because the employer wanted a younger-
    looking worker to do the job; (b) receiving a negative job evaluation because of
    not being “flexible” in accepting new projects; (c) being fired because the boss
    wanted to keep younger, less paid workers; (d) denying a promotion, which went
    to someone younger hired from outside the company because the boss said the
    company “needs new blood”; (e) being laid off while a younger worker with less
    seniority and less on-the-job experience was retained; and (f) before being
    discharged, the supervisor shared age-related remarks such as older workers
    are “over-the-hill” or “ancient.”</p>
