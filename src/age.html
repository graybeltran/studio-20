      The opportunities that baby boomers and millennials have today is a result of the demand and supply factors, said Yaw Nyarko, professor of economics at New York University. “On the supply of jobs side, casual observation suggests that today in comparison to the past there are more gig like jobs around relative to the old-fashioned permanent or 9 to 5 jobs.”
