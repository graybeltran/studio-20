        <h4> New York is creating jobs at a faster pace than the rest of the country, but even here, these job opportunities come with caveats.

        Lisa Tesoro, 60, was forced out of her first, more lucrative career during the recession. She now works two jobs and makes about $10 an hour working as a chef in New York. And earns about $23 an hour at her bartending job in New Jersey.

        Ryan Gingery, on the other hand, is 29, a Columbia University graduate and she embraces flexible job models as a professional babysitter.

     Baby boomers are finding it difficult to retire, while many millennials prefer working flexible hours. As these generations compete for work, they are presented with very different opportunities. Research by the AARP,  a non-profit lobbying  for the elderly, found that “nearly 2 out of 3 workers over 45 have seen or experienced age discrimination.” Despite laws prohibiting age related discrimination many find that proving it is challenging.
