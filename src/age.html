      <h2 style="text-align: center; color: #d98032">1967</h2>
      <p>The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) of 1967 was passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson. The labour law prohibits employment discrimination against anyone 40 years of age and older.
        <br>
        <br>
      The ADEA applies to employers with 20 or more employees and stipulates that employers are not allowed to hire, terminate, promote, or decide an employee’s compensation based on age. The law also forbids discrimination in other aspects of employment (e.g., wages, job assignments, layoffs, training, and fringe benefits).

      <h2 style="text-align: center; color: #d98032">1975</h2>
      <p>The Age Discrimination Act of 1975 prohibits discrimination on the basis of age in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.
        <br>
        <br>
      The Act, which applies to all ages, permits the use of certain age distinctions and factors other than age that meet the Act's requirements. The Age Discrimination Act is enforced by the Civil Rights Center.

      <h2 style="text-align: center; color: #d98032">1990</h2>
      <p>A clause was added to the ADEA that prevented the forced retirement of tenured employees such as college professors. The Older Workers Benefit Protection Act amended the ADEA, prohibiting employers from denying benefits to older employees.
        <br>
        <br>
      Congress recognized that the cost of providing certain benefits to older workers was greater than the cost of providing those same benefits to younger workers.

      <h2 style="text-align: center; color: #d98032">2019</h2>
      <p>The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago earlier this year limited the scope of the legislation by stating that the “key provisions (of the law) only apply to those who already have jobs and not individuals who are looking for jobs.</p>
