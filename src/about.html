    <h2>A MULTIMEDIA TALE OF TWO CITIES</h2>

      <p>
        June 2009 marked the end of the Great Recession in the US, 10 years later, in NY, when this crisis started, top 1 percent make 44 times more than bottom 99 percent. Only 7 people of color were admitted to elite public schools of New York City. Manhattan remains as one of the cities with the highest rent in the country while 63,615 people are homeless. These are only a few figures that show that life in the Big Apple is indeed a tale of two cities. But behind those figures, there are real people. The Great Divide addresses five topics -housing, age discrimination, education, identity and immigration- to show two sides of each one. This multimedia project features video, data visualization, photography and text about each of these 10 people that represent different versions of the New York.
